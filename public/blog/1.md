Gone are the days of escaping from the US into Canada or Mexico. Cities entered
in the USA map now **only** return cities in the USA. This was just caused by a
small mistake in the US map metadata.

A rendering issue with the circle has also been fixed! No longer will cities
within the circle be marked as 'too far' on some maps. The circle is the hard
definition, the single truth, the one absolute.

The delay in entering the first city on newly opened maps has also been
vanquished! Well, not really vanquished but rather _✨optimised✨_ so that delay
is not really noticeable.

Some new maps have also been added!

- **[France](/singleplayer/france)**

- **[Greece](/singleplayer/greece)**

- **[Fife](/singleplayer/fife)** (Hard!)
