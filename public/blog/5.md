This post covers a few fixes and quality of life stuff but to make it more
interesting, I will first introduce to you 3 new maps!

- **[China](/singleplayer/china)**

- **[Switzerland](/singleplayer/switzerland)**

- **[Asia*](/singleplayer/asia)**

**\***
Defining the borders of the Asia map was quite a challenging decision. I currently
use the Web Mercator projection for the maps, which makes countries like Russia
massive! Therefore, to make this map less challenging and sparse, I have decided to remove
Russia and Kazakhstan from the map, eventhough they may typically be considered to
be part of Asia. Turkey is also excluded from Asia as I felt that turkey already
plays a nice part in the Europe map anyway.

On the topic of map improvements, Gibraltar has been finally added to the Europe
map! It was previously missing due to a mistake on my part but that is now
resovled.

I also resolved a minor bug with the input placeholder (the 's' bug), and in the
process changed the placeholder just a tiny bit. A line has also been placed
under the input box for a bit of visual clairty.

Finally, I have begun the process of adding basic shortcuts, and the first one
added is the enter key for the 'Play again' button. Pressing enter once you
complete a map is now equivalent to clicking 'Play again'.
