Although it has been a while since the last update, I have been busy behind the
lines! Much of Routle's internal logic has been refactored to be more decoupled
and simpler, and I am quite proud of it! A fun side-effect is that now the rare
firefox bug is fixed!

I have also begun writing automated end-to-end tests using a cool framework
called Cypress! From now on I will be taking a more test-driven approach when
adding new features as having that extra safety net of tests is really helpful.
A good indicator of how many tests I have been writing is by checking the
percentage of languages used in Routle
**[here](https://github.com/Daniel5055/routle)** on github. All the tests are
written in JavaScript, and as of writing this, that number is now at around 38%!
However, whether they are effective or not is up to you!

This post would be pretty boring without adding new content, so I'll start with
the small addition first. The Ã…land islands have been added to Europe!
Previously they were not included because I forgot to add their ISO code to the
list of allowed countries.

Now since that is out of the way, onto the big additions. Bless the rains! New Maps have been added! The
following maps are now available to play:

- **[Africa](/singleplayer/africa)**

- **[Scandinavia](/singleplayer/scandinavia)**

- **[Balkans](/singleplayer/balkans)**
