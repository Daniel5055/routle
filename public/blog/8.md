I have added a dedicated **[settings page](/settings)** where players can alter the following game rules:

- **Difficulty**: Changes the size of the player circle.

- **Priority**: Determines which city of the same name is picked. One of:

  - **Proximity**: The closest city always (default).

  - **Population**: The most populous city always.

  - **Hybrid**: The most populous city inside the player circle, and the closest city outside of it.

- **Holes**: This adds inaccessible holes to the map to give players a challenge. You can modify the number of holes and the size of the holes. Holes will be generated at random if enabled.

A new map has also been added by request:

- **[The USSR](/singleplayer/ussr)**
